# Getting Started

Application is comprised of a serverless api gateway and a create-react-app layer. 

The following tools are required

- node v14 at least
- npm

## Backend

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4000/api/users' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName": "John Doe",
    "email": "ceo@industrybit.xyz"
}'
```

## Frontend

```
cd client
```
